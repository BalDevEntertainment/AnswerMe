# TwitterViewer

## [IMPORTANT]

Create a file called secrets.properties with the following structure:

TWITTER_API_KEY="the_provided_api_key"

This is to avoid publishing the api key on a public repo.


## [TODO]
### MVP: Minimal viable product

**- Support rotation of the phone without loosing any data on screen**

**- Even though it sounds unnecessary; use a Fragment for the UI**


### Optional
**- Show the first image associated to a tweet (or all of them if you want)**



## [Finished]

**- Show the list of tweets listed by the based on the search term**

**- Have the app support Android OS 2.3 and up (API 10)**

**- Third party libraries.**
